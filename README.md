# springBootApp
Spring boot application.
Read this file to understand how to setup the application on local and execute curl command to call the endpoints.

# A. Steps to setup the application and run maven build.

  1. Import the code on local drive.
  2. Open cmd prompt on local and cd to the path of directory where code is imported.
  3. Run the command **mvn clean install** to build the application and run the tests.
  4. Once the build finishes successfully run the command **java -jar *************************** to start the application          
  5. Once the server starts successfully the application should be up and running on port 9090 (default configured port in               application.properties)
